I am passionate about health services research aimed at increasing the efficiency and responsiveness of health systems and diminishing inequalities in health and in access to healthcare globally. Currently, I am focusing on the health care utilization envelope project providing inpatient and outpatient admission rate estimates in every location within the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study framework. In my work with the Clinical Informatics team at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, I have a chance to apply skills in data wrangling and visualization, multilevel modeling, metaregression tools, and data seeking and extraction through systematic search and collaborator outreach.

Prior to joining IHME, I obtained a medical degree from Sechenov University in Moscow, Russia and an MSc in Global Health Science and Epidemiology from Oxford University thereafter. During my studies, I was striving to contribute to international research projects in population health with a focus on the post-COVID-19 condition, mental health, and allergy. Though these endeavors, I acquired leadership and management skills, got familiar with the process of scientific publication, learned electronic database management and received practical knowledge of epidemiological study design and foundations of association analysis. The list of resulting publications can be accessed via https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4291-5052. 

Importantly, I do my best to facilitate a friendly and inclusive environment in the workplace by actively participating in related initiatives. As such, I currently lead an Employee Resource Group (ERG) for postdocs and researchers at the Institute working toward building a sense of community amongst us and providing systemic tools and knowledge base for professional growth.

In my free time I enjoy playing the piano, DJing, kickboxing, reading, traveling and simply spending time with my loved ones.
